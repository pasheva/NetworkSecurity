I spend most of the time working on the building and understanding the actual
proxy. My initial idea was to be able to create the proxy and manage
to run it sucessfully and then attemp the jaca script injection.
However, I did run into issue creating the proxy and I was unable to complete
the task. My script simply starts with creating the socket in order to
listen for the incoming connections based on the ip and port given from
the user. When the connection is set and recived the thread is set and the
clients data from the browser request is passed on so I can parse it.
After that I am able to create the proxy server and from then on I was not able
to solve of how to inject javascript. I had several attempts but nothing worked
properly so I ommited it from the final submission.
