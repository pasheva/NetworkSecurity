Frequency Analysis Substitution.

I did not have enough time to write the whole algorithm so I
did most of it by hand. First, I started of by analying the
frequency of each letter and mapping it to the frequency in letters
in the English lagnauge. From then on the idea was to change the
letters as I keep decrypting and acoding any duplicates, such as
'a' corresponding to two different letters.  The next analysis I did
was to get the one word letter and decide, which one is 'a' and 'i'.
There is also a grammatical part which could be inserted of the language.
Such as that 'a' would appear more as a first letter of the words or
Trigraphs "and". Moreover, 'i' if in the beginning of a sentance is most likely
followed by some Trigraph  or Digprah such as "was" "am" "can", therefore,
I am , one after another would be two different chars. After, that I started analyzing the
^ ^
Digprahs and Trigraphs and substituting for them. From then one, I read through the text,
and once I noticed a word which was resembling an actual one in English I would switch
the word and change the corresponding letters. This also could be done using a dictionary with
English words, such as that once there is 80% or 90% match the word can be replaced and the
letters substitution changed.
This should be done in repeated manner once most of the words match  English words. There could
be exceptions such as names and lables, which would cause the text to may be fully properly substituted
for a very small percentage.
